# Notes on a paper about timing microcontrollers,.
The paper I am reading is [Designing Embedded Systems with PIC Microcontrollers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781856177504100125)

* Chapter 9 discusses the PWM and how timing can be used in serial communication.
* Section 9.6 mentiones software PWM, for hardware that doesn't have the ability to regulate itself.
