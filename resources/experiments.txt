Bitties Network Experiments
10.12.24

------------------------------------------
Write scripts to run each experiment repeatdly and export data.

Collect and export detailed logs from each experiment for post-processing and analysis in .csv or .txt files. 
        - Python will be used to interperet this data.

Speed Tests:

Experiment 1: Latency of Message Transmission
Objective: Measure how quickly a message can be sent, received, processed, and responded to.
Setup:
    - Embed the send_message function into the read_message function to create a round-trip cycle.
    - Start with a simple fixed-size message.
    - Measure the total round-trip time using timestamps taken before sending and after receiving a message.
    - Average round-trip time over 100 iterations.

Experiment 2: Maximum Send Rate
Objective: Identify the fastest rate at which messages can be sent without system crashes.
Setup: 
    - Gradually increase the message sending rate from a low, stable rate to the maximum possible rate.
    - Watch for errors as rates increase. When they are regularly occuring, stepdown to find the rate at which they don't
    - Test tentative max send rate over 100 iterations.

Experiment 3: Optimal Transmission Rate
Objective: Determine the most reliable and stable transmission rate.
Setup:
    - Perform repeated message transmission at different rates (from low to high).
    - Track error rates and message throughput.
    - Identify the rate at which the error rate remains acceptably low (<1% errors).
    - Test tentative reliable send rate over 100 iterations.

Error Tests:

Experiment 1: Error Frequency at Default Speed (same as optimal transmisision rate exp. but just focus more on errors)

Experiment 2: Error Rate vs. Speed
Objective: Understand how error rates change as the transmission speed increases.
Setup:
    - Track how the number and severity of errors increase with speed.
    - Follow error rate as a function of transmission speed, identifying critical thresholds where errors become prohibitive.

Experiment 3: Stress Test with Message Volume
Objective: Determine how many messages can be processed before the system breaks.
Setup: 
    - Send messages continuously for a fixed period of time (1 hour perhaps)
    - Monitor for system crashes.

Experiment 4: Hamming Error Detection and Correction
Objective: Intentionally damage packets during transmission
Setup: 
    - Put a bit flipping operator in logic before packet is sent.
    - Report error messages and final received messages.

Experiment 5: Max Message Side
Objective: See how large of packets can be sent.
Setup:
    - Continuosly increase packet size until program breaks or delay become insufficient.

Network Scalability Tests:

Experiment 1: Two-Pair Communication Test
Objective: Test how the network handles two independent pairs of devices communicating simultaneously.
Setup: 
    - Connect four devices to the network.
    - Have two pairs of devices exchange messages in parallel.
    - Monitor for message interference or delays between the two conversations.

Experiment 2: Four Devices in a Shared Chatroom
Objective: Test the network's capacity to handle multi-party communication.
    Setup:
    - Have all four devices join a shared chatroom, where messages are broadcast to all participants.
    - Measure how well the system handles message distribution and synchronization.
