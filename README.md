## How we will work together
### Branching Policies
* Individual working branches 
* Merge into main for finished code
* Currently no protections on main
### Directories
* Progress Reports - latex uncompiled code
* Research - Papers and links with research
* BiBTex - Citations
### Languages
* Maybe use Golang?
* Otherwise C
* Compiler - GCC
### Communication
* Text message preferred
* Respond same day - for urgent things more quickly
* Shared outlook calender
* No group meetings after 8pm
* Default to meeting in the classroom
* Expected to work during class, and some during the afternoon
* No issues if the work gets done  
* Once we have a clearer set of tasks, we will make a system of allocating and following each task
