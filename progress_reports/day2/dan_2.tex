\section*{Previous Goals and Deliverables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Light experiment - Group
    \item Read basic networking background material - Group
    \item Timing, clocks, etc, (documentation, NRZ) - Stuart
    \item Error detection/correction research - Dan
    \item Update project outline - next update Thursday

%% Sections above should be short bullets. Longer free form discussion of
information from above goes here. These should still be short! More that a couple
sentences and the discussion is better suited as a results write-up, appendix, or
design document.
\section*{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
\item After getting our footing connecting the Pi and the NIC, we worked on a light experiment. After some
painful troubleshooting, we discovered errors in our pin mapping from yesterday, and then managed to make all
the transmitter lights turn on and off (see how with test.c in experiments).
\item
