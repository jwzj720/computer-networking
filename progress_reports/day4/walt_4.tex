%% Section enumerating progress from the previous day. Items people were responsible for in the last progress report must appear. Additional tasks that the group agreed to add since the last progress report may be presented here.
\section*{Previous Goals and Deliverables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Debug program for receiving manchester encoding data (DONE) - Stuart
    \item Develop standard packet expectations - group
    \item Create character encoding/decoding to allow text transfer - Dan
    \item develop functionality for repairing broken packets using error detection and bit replacement.
\end{itemize}

%% Sections above should be short bullets. Longer free form discussion of information from above goes here. These should still be short! More that a couple sentences and the discussion is better suited as a results write-up, appendix, or design document.
\section*{Discussion}
